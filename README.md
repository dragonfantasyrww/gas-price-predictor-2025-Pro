## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a **gas-price-predictor** integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### The Core Concept: Why Gas Price Prediction Matters

First, it's crucial to understand that a gas-price-predictor is primarily relevant for trading on **Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains** (like Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche C-chain). "Gas" is the fee required to execute transactions on these networks.

A sophisticated predictor doesn't just guess the current gas price; it forecasts short-term fluctuations. This capability is integrated into automated trading systems to optimize two key areas:

1.  **Trade Execution Cost:** Minimizing the cost of placing, modifying, and canceling orders.
2.  **DeFi Strategy Timing:** Optimizing the timing for interactions with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols (e.g., liquidations, arbitrage, yield harvesting) which are highly gas-sensitive.

### The Integration Architecture: How It All Connects

The integration is a multi-layered system where the gas predictor acts as a critical input for the trading engine. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:
